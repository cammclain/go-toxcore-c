package toxcore

// Toxcore is a package that provides access to the Toxcore library.
// It allows you to create and manage Tox instances, send messages, and handle events.

// â€¢ High-Level API: In a separate package (e.g., internal/api or in pkg/toxcore), build an idiomatic Go interface that hides the cgo complexity.
