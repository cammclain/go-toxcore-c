package cgo

// this file contains the cgo bindings for the toxcore library
// Toxcore is a C library, so we need to use cgo to call it
// toxcore can be found at https://github.com/TokTok/c-toxcore

//â€¢ Low-Level Bindings: Create a dedicated package (e.g., internal/cgo) that contains all cgo directives and bindings.
