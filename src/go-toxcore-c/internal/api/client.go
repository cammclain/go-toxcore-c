package api

// Client is the interface for the Tox client API

// • Define a central type (e.g., ToxClient) that encapsulates the Tox client’s state and exposes methods for initialization, bootstrapping, messaging, and shutdown.

// • Use modern Go error handling (with %w for wrapping and, if needed, errors.Join for aggregated errors) and context (for cancellation and timeouts).
